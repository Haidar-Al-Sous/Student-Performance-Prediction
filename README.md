# Student-Performance-Prediction
## Introduction
This project explores various machine learning techniques to predict student performance in higher education. The study utilizes supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms to identify students at risk of academic failure.

The project aims to develop a system that predicts students who may face academic difficulties, allowing for timely interventions. It uses data from the Higher Institute of Applied Arts in Portugal, including demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors. You can find it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success).

We have three labels we have to predict (these info were colletected at enrollment):
1. Dropout: it means the student is a dropout and has a very probability of dropping out.
2. Enrolled: it means the is still still enrolled but a has moderate probability of dropping out.
3. Graduate: the student is graduated and thus has a low probability of dropping out.

## Methodology
### Supervised learning


### Semi-supervised learning


### Unsupervised learning
